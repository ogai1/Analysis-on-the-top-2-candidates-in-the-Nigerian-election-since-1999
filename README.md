## by Oluchukwu Onyemaenu

## Introduction
In Nigeria, there are over 10 political parties that contest for elections on various polictical level every electoral season and amongst all the political parties, 2 parties end up with over 90% of the total votes casted in each election. The top 2 politcal parties change from season to season but So far, a political party that has been sustained through the years is the People's Democratic Party (PDP).
This analysis has been conducted at the presidential level since 1999 through to 2019.

## Data Source 
The data set was obtained through [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xibilolu/nigerian-election-results-19992019) site. It contains dataset from both the presidential and gubertornial election since 1999 and holds 17 files with 28 columns.
Due to an inec-led webpage restructuring in 2010 the results from older years are accurate but incomplete. This led to data loss on the site.

## Data Wrangling and Transformation
* Analysis was performed in PowerBi
* New measures were created to determine the total number of votes for each of the 2 main political partiesfor each election year.
* Sorted and filtered the dataset to determine the highest and lowest votes by political party and state.
* No data model was created because the datasets were analyzed separately.
