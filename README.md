## Objective
To

## Data Source 
The data set was obtained through [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xibilolu/nigerian-election-results-19992019) site. It contains dataset from both the presidential and gubertornial election since 1999 and holds 17 files with 28 columns.
Due to an inec-led webpage restructuring in 2010 the results from older years are accurate but incomplete. This led to data loss on the site.

## Data Wrangling and Transformation
* New measures were created to determine the total number of votes for each of the 2 main political parties.
* Sorted and filtered the dataset to determine the highest and lowest votes by party and state.
A data model wasn't created beacuse I analysed the dataset individually.
